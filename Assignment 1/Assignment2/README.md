## Given Prompt for gpt-engineer

"Develop a comprehensive All Unit Converter application that allows users to convert between various units of measurement. The application should support conversions for different categories such as length, area, volume, temperature, mass, and more. Here are the main features the application should have:

1. Unit Categories: Users should be able to select a category (e.g., length, area, volume, temperature, mass, etc.) from a list of available categories.

2. Source and Target Units: Within each category, users should be able to choose the source unit and the target unit from a list of commonly used units for that category. For example, in the 'length' category, options could include meters, feet, inches, and more.

3. Amount Input: Users should be able to input the quantity they want to convert.

4. Conversion: When the user selects the category, source unit, target unit, and enters the quantity, the application should display the converted result.

5. Bi-Directional Conversion: The application should support both forward and reverse conversions. That is, users should be able to convert from source to target units and vice versa.

6. User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the application. It can be a command-line tool or a graphical user interface (GUI), depending on your preference.

7. Additional Features: If you'd like, you can add extra features such as saving conversion history, custom unit conversions, and the ability to update unit definitions.

8. Documentation: Ensure that your code is well-documented, and you can include comments explaining the logic behind your implementation.

Create it using basic vanilla javascript, html and css. Make sure that it covers a wide range of unit categories and units within each category for a comprehensive user experience.
