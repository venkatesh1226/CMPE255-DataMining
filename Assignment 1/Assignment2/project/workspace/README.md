Based on the requirements and assumptions, the application will be structured into three main files: `index.html` for the structure of the web page, `styles.css` for the styling, and `main.js` for the functionality. 

The `main.js` file will contain the following core functions:

1. `populateCategories()`: This function will populate the dropdown menu with the available unit categories.
2. `populateUnits()`: This function will populate the source and target unit dropdown menus based on the selected category.
3. `convertUnits()`: This function will perform the unit conversion based on the selected category, source unit, target unit, and input quantity.
4. `swapUnits()`: This function will swap the source and target units for bi-directional conversion.
5. `saveHistory()`: This function will save the conversion history.
6. `loadHistory()`: This function will load the conversion history.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

index.html
