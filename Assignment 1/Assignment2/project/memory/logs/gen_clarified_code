The application should support conversions for different categories such as length, area, volume, temperature, mass, and more. Here are the main features the application should have:\n\n1. Unit Categories: Users should be able to select a category (e.g., length, area, volume, temperature, mass, etc.) from a list of available categories.\n\n2. Source and Target Units: Within each category, users should be able to choose the source unit and the target unit from a list of commonly used units for that category. For example, in the 'length' category, options could include meters, feet, inches, and more.\n\n3. Amount Input: Users should be able to input the quantity they want to convert.\n\n4. Conversion: When the user selects the category, source unit, target unit, and enters the quantity, the application should display the converted result.\n\n5. Bi-Directional Conversion: The application should support both forward and reverse conversions. That is, users should be able to convert from source to target units and vice versa.\n\n6. User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the application. It can be a command-line tool or a graphical user interface (GUI), depending on your preference.\n\n7. Additional Features: If you'd like, you can add extra features such as saving conversion history, custom unit conversions, and the ability to update unit definitions.\n\n8. Documentation: Ensure that your code is well-documented, and you can include comments explaining the logic behind your implementation.\n\nCreate it using basic vanilla javascript, html and css.

For example, for length - meters, kilometers, miles, yards, feet, inches; for temperature - Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, etc.\n3.

Conversion: The converted result will be displayed in a clear and easy-to-read format immediately after the user inputs all necessary information.\n5. Bi-Directional Conversion: The application will allow users to easily switch between source and target units for reverse conversions.\n6. User-Friendly Interface: The interface will be simple and intuitive, with clear labels and instructions. It will be a graphical user interface (GUI).\n7. Additional Features: The application will include a history feature that saves previous conversions, and a custom unit conversion feature that allows users to add their own units.\n8. Documentation: The code will be thoroughly documented with comments explaining the logic and functionality of each part.\n9. Development Tools: The application will be developed using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, without the use of any libraries or frameworks.\n10.
